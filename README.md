# Smartcontract AI-Agentic System

## Overview
Smartcontract-AI-Agentic-System is a **FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) project** that automates the entire lifecycle of Solidity smart contracts using an **AI-Agentic pipeline**. This system enables users to **build, audit, test, analyze, optimize, and deploy** secure and efficient smart contracts with the help of multiple AI agents.

## Features
- **AI-powered contract generation** using Mistral AI.
- **Security auditing** to detect vulnerabilities like reentrancy, integer overflow, and improper access control.
- **Gas optimization** for improved efficiency and cost savings.
- **Automated test case generation** using Hardhat or Foundry.
- **Seamless deployment** with OpenZeppelin integration. (V4*)
- **Etherscan verification** for transparency and trust.
- **Modular multi-agent system** for scalability and flexibility.

## How It Works
1. **User Inputs Requirements** â€“ Define the contract's functionality. Example: `Create a simple escrow contract where Alice sends 10 ETH to Bob after Carol approves.`
2. **AI Agents Generate Code** â€“ Secure Solidity code is created based on best practices.
3. **Security Audit** â€“ Code is analyzed for vulnerabilities and compliance.
4. **Optimization** â€“ Enhances efficiency and gas usage.
5. **Test Case Generation** â€“ Generates automated tests.
6. **Deployment & Verification** â€“ Deploys to Ethereum-compatible networks and verifies on Etherscan. (*i'm not implement this completly for security issues*)

## Installation & Usage
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/blue-lotus-org/Smartcontract-AI-Agentic-System.git
